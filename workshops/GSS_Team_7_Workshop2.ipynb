The grading criteria is that if the average score (mean) of 5 exams for a students is above 90 (include 90), then the student should get an A grade. If the average score is between 80 and 90 (include 80 but not 90), the student will receive a B grade. If the grade is below 80, the students will receive a C grade (strictly below 80).\n",
